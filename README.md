# Adaptive-bike-riding-for-limb-amputtes

1. Introduction
For lower limb amputees, riding a motorcycle presents a significant challenge due to foot-operated gear shifting. This limitation restricts their mobility and independence, preventing them from participating in activities that could improve their mental, physical, and social well-being. This project proposes an adaptive hand-operated gear system that eliminates the need for foot-based controls, allowing amputees to shift gears seamlessly using a handlebar-mounted switch.

The system integrates a PCB-controlled transmitter, a receiver-driven stepper motor, and a pinion gear mechanism to achieve precise and smooth gear shifting. With a focus on usability, accessibility, and rehabilitation, this solution empowers amputees to regain their independence and participate in everyday commuting and recreational biking.

2. Problem Statement & Motivation
Challenges for Amputees in Motorbike Riding
Traditional motorcycles require foot operation for gear shifting, making it nearly impossible for lower limb amputees to ride.
Lack of adaptive technology for motorcycles, limiting amputees‚Äô transportation options.
Limited mobility reduces independence, social interaction, and mental well-being.
Current prosthetic solutions are expensive and not widely available, making everyday biking inaccessible.
Project Motivation
This project is inspired by advancements in adaptive vehicle technologies and aims to bring the same level of innovation to motorcycles. It bridges the gap between assistive technology and mainstream transportation, ensuring amputees can ride safely and comfortably.

3. Proposed Solution: Hand-Operated Gear System
The solution replaces traditional foot-dependent gear mechanisms with a hand-controlled system, making motorcycles accessible to amputees.

Key Components & Functionality
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hand-Operated Switch ‚Äì Mounted on the handlebar for easy thumb control.
2Ô∏è‚É£ PCB Transmitter ‚Äì Processes user input and sends signals wirelessly.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Receiver Module ‚Äì Receives signals and commands the stepper motor.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Stepper Motor & Pinion Gear ‚Äì Controls the gear mechanism for smooth shifting.

How It Works
The user presses the switch, sending an electrical signal.
The PCB transmitter relays this signal wirelessly to the receiver.
The receiver activates the stepper motor, precisely adjusting the pinion gear to shift gears.
This ensures a smooth, quick, and effortless transition between gears without requiring foot movement.
